# Linear-Regression-Live-Series

This repository contains files and resources to complement the Codecademy Live: Linear Regression with Python series. We recommend downloading the data and code files prior to each livestream if you want to code along with us! We also recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which will simultaneously download Python, Jupyter notebooks, and a number of relevant libraries &mdash; making it even easier to follow along.

* Session 1 (5/18/21 11am ET):
  * [Data and code files](1-intro-to-simple-linear-regression)
  * [Youtube link]()
  * Learn more by taking the Simple Linear Regression lesson in the [Linear Regression with Python](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/linear-regression-mssp) skill path on Codecademy.
