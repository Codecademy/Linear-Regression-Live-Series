# Linear-Regression-Live-Series

This repository contains files and resources to complement the Codecademy Live: Linear Regression with Python series. We recommend downloading the data and code files prior to each livestream if you want to code along with us! We also recommend downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual), which will simultaneously download Python, Jupyter notebooks, and a number of relevant libraries &mdash; making it even easier to follow along.
